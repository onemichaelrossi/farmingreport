# Setting up the data-fetch script on your PC (Windows)

This folder (`scripts/`) contains the program that fetches weather data and
publishes it to the dashboard. It's designed to run from a normal clone of
this repository on your own machine, on a schedule, so the public dashboard
always shows current data without you having to do anything by hand.

## How it fits together

- **`config/sites.json`** (one level up) — the list of sites you want tracked. Edit this to add, rename or remove sites.
- **`scripts/fetch_weather.py`** — pulls weather, soil, and rainfall data for every site in `sites.json`, works out Growing Degree Days, dollar spot disease risk and a simple irrigation water balance, and writes the results into `data/`.
- **`scripts/run_fetch.bat`** — a one-line wrapper so Windows Task Scheduler can run the Python script.
- **`index.html`** — the public dashboard. It just reads the JSON files in `data/`, so as soon as `fetch_weather.py` commits and pushes new data, the live site updates too.

The script only uses Python's standard library — nothing needs to be
`pip install`-ed.

## One-off setup

1. **Install Python**, if you don't already have it: [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/). During install, tick "Add python.exe to PATH".

2. **Clone the repository** to a folder you're happy to leave in place long-term, e.g.:

   ```
   cd C:\Users\Michael\Documents
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/farmingreport.git
   ```

   This folder *is* the "working files" folder — the script commits and pushes from inside it, so don't move it once it's set up.

3. **Check git can push without prompting for a password every time.** If `git clone` above worked and you're not asked for credentials repeatedly when you `git push`, you're already set up (e.g. via Git Credential Manager or an SSH key) and can skip to step 4.

4. **Test it once by hand.** Open Command Prompt in the cloned folder and run:

   ```
   cd farmingreport\scripts
   python fetch_weather.py
   ```

   You should see log lines for each site, and `data\index.json` / `data\sites\*.json` should be updated. Check `scripts\fetch.log` if anything looks wrong — every run appends a timestamped line there.

5. **Register the scheduled task.** Open Command Prompt **as Administrator** and run (adjust the path to wherever you cloned the repo):

   ```
   schtasks /create /tn "FarmingReport Weather Update" /tr "\"C:\Users\Michael\Documents\farmingreport\scripts\run_fetch.bat\"" /sc hourly /mo 3 /rl highest
   ```

   This runs the script every 3 hours. Adjust `/mo 3` (hours) to taste — weather/turf data doesn't usually need updating more often than every few hours. You can also use `/sc daily /st 06:00` for a single fixed time per day instead.

   Prefer the GUI? Open **Task Scheduler** → *Create Task* → on the **Triggers** tab add a new trigger set to repeat every few hours → on the **Actions** tab set "Start a program" to `run_fetch.bat` with "Start in" set to the `scripts` folder.

6. **Confirm it's working**: after the next scheduled run, check `scripts\fetch.log`, then check the live dashboard URL — it should show the new "last updated" time.

## Adding more sites

Edit `config\sites.json`. Only `name` and `postcode` are required:

```json
{
  "sites": [
    { "name": "Michael's House", "postcode": "SK7 1AT" },
    { "name": "North Field", "postcode": "SK9 4AA", "gdd_base_temp_c": 6, "season_start": "03-01" }
  ]
}
```

Optional fields per site:

- `slug` — used in the data filename and the dashboard's URL; auto-generated from `name` if omitted.
- `gdd_base_temp_c` — Growing Degree Day base temperature in °C (default `6`, a common cool-season turf/grass baseline; use whatever's right for what you're growing).
- `season_start` — `MM-DD` when GDD accumulation resets each year (default `01-01`).
- `dollar_spot_threshold_pct` — the risk % at which the dashboard flags a spray-worthy risk (default `20`, per the Smith-Kerns model's usual guidance).
- `flood_search_radius_km` — how far to search for an Environment Agency rainfall station (default `15`). EA data only covers England & Wales; sites elsewhere in the UK will show no rainfall-station data (everything else still works).

Save the file, and the next scheduled run will pick up the change automatically — no need to touch the script itself.

## Notes on the disease/irrigation figures

- **Dollar spot risk** uses the published Smith-Kerns logistic regression model (5-day average relative humidity and temperature). It's a widely used turf-management model, not a guarantee — treat the 20% threshold as a prompt to go and inspect the turf, not an automatic spray trigger.
- **Water balance** is a simple 7-day running total of ET0 (reference evapotranspiration) minus rainfall. A "deficit" means more moisture has left than has fallen recently — a signal to consider irrigation, not a soil-moisture measurement in itself (the dashboard also shows Open-Meteo's modelled soil moisture separately).
- All figures are modelled from Open-Meteo's forecast/historical weather data, not on-site sensors. Cross-check against real sensors if the dashboard ever informs a spray or high-stakes irrigation decision.
